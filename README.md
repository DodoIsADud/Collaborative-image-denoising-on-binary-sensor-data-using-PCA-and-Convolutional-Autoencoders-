# Collaborative-image-denoising-on-binary-sensor-data-using-PCA-and-Convolutional-Autoencoders-
Converted some image files(scaled down to 256*256 size) to binary pickle files, trained encoder and decoder models for Convolutional
Autoencoders(using Tensorflow and Keras backend).Calculated the loss function and optimizer, evaluated the denoised image metric scale
[mean psnr and mean ssim].

Also learned the use of bm3D denoiser and proximal mapping with generic Plug-and-Play ADMM prior algorithm from MATLAB documentation code.
